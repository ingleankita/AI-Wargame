# AI-Wargame-COMP-472

## Project Description
The objective of this project is to program an AI Wargame where it can be played in three ways: Human vs Human, Human vs AI and AI vs AI. The game consists of an attacker(a) and a defender(d) on a 5X5 board. The goal is to defeat the opponent's AI unit. This game will be implemented using a minimax algorithm + alpha-beta pruning and at least 2 heuristics.
